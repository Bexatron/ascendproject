If you're on this site, hopefully it's because you've already learned about Ascend, have put in an [application](http://ascendproject.org/apply), and are now curious to know more about what this program will be about.

The Portland Ascend Project (September 8 - October 17, 2014) is the very first pilot of this training program so please be patient as content will continue to get added and improved on this site moving forward.

Just a little information for right now:

We're in the beginning stages of trying to find people who are interested in the Portland program coming up in the Fall.  The [application form](http://ascendproject.org/apply) is live and will be accepting responses until June 30th.  There will be posters and flyers getting out to many physical locations in Portland as well as our best attempts at word-of-mouth campaigns and press releases to try and cast a wide net to find *anyone* who is looking for this type of experience and learning.

Once applications are closed we'll move to Round 2 of the participant selection process which involves asking all applicants to go through the Codeacademy JavaScript course online (it's free!) and showing their completion badge to proceed to Round 3.  For people who apply and do not have reliable access to computer and/or internet we will hold office hours at the Mozilla Portland Space where there will be computers and mentors available while you do the course.  

After the period of time assigned to completing the JavaScript course we'll sit down and have a short interview & written statement requested of all those who completed the badge.  This is to help us get a sense of what you're looking for in the course, how it will work into your current situation, and generally just helps us figure out if there's anything about this program that might need to shift to accomodate you, should you be selected to be one of the 20 participants in the first program.

All potential participants will be made aware of the final decisions before the end of July.  The training starts up on September 8th, 2014.

We'll have a lot more details on this site between now and then and if you have any questions, please use the Contact link up in the top corner of the site to reach out over email.
