      bio: "Most significant work I've done is at KPFK, Los Angeles the 2nd Pacifica radio station. A free-form non-commercial radio station where I worked in the subscriptions office but got training in their apprentice program. From there I started recording events, interviews and producing programs. Many of the topics were on health and public affairs (speaking events, politics, government corruption). In Oregon my interests include gardening/permaculture, off-grid-living and just about anything odd.  To a lesser extent I have volunteered and worked at KBOO, a local public radio station.  Former techno geek, 'cuz right now I can barely adjust the audio on my computer.   I did own a portable TRS-80 that printed on paper rolls using color ink pens and ran on the BASIC program. If my friends read this they would say, 'You forgot to mention you ride an old bike and your car is more worn out than the bike!' I do hope to own an electric vehicle someday."
