Monday: Mostly worked on bug finding I found a few in Popcorn I'm interested in. I was trying to keep the dev environment the same so that I could power through them....but I'm not really excited about any of the other bugs in Popcorn right now. We'll see there are a couple of options.

We also wrote the intros to our talks and practiced talking for 1 minute. It occurred to me that 1 minute isn't that long. And we only need to talk for 5 of those not very long increments....so maybe I could survive. It seemed a little less daunting. Don't get me wrong, still terrifying just less daunting.

Tuesday: We had a really cool work shop on resum√©s by Hope Nielson. She was really awesome had a lot of energy and made a kind of boring topic entertaining. Everybody had a lot of good questions and it was interesting to learn what people could legally ask you and ways that were legal but in the end could get the same info (or close to it). Learned about [Glassdoor](glassdoor.com) that seems to be a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips.

The second half of class we worked on any loose ends we may have, opw applications, word press, presentations, our bugs....basically anything we haven't finished yet. So I've been writing more of my talk and I still need to make a child theme for my word press. Did a little blogging.

Wednesday: This morning I had a talk with my daughter. She was feeling sad that our schedule has been so hectic the last few weeks. I told things would calm down in just 3 more days. My eyes started to get a big misty. She asked why I was sad, I told her it was hard to think about leaving school and all my new friends. I was given such an amazing opportunity to learn and I just wanted to keep learning. Her solution was she was going to start an after school art class to teach me to draw Pokemon. I think I'm going to like that class.

Finished writing my speech. I still feel like I have a ways to go before I present on Friday. It is very daunting. But I had a lot of fun practicing Amanda!

Thursday: [Speech day!](https://air.mozilla.org/channels/ascend/) Half of the class went today, Adam, Amanda, Candida, Mary Anne, Lisa, Tina, David, and Peri! Everyone did a great job. Especially because everyone was under the impression that the podium would be available during our talks. I'm feeling pretty distraught over but what has Ascend been but a bunch of challenges thrown our way...what's one more? I did my dry run for Lukas and Kronda today. I have given my talk 4 times and all was fine maybe a little robotic - not too bad. But I walked in there and was shaking before we ever started talking. I have some issues with public speaking. I avoid it like the plague. I'm hoping that it was my nerves about "performing it" for the first time, but at some point my voice cracked and I was suddenly aware of things like my heart racing and my inability to regulate my breathing while talking. I suddenly felt very overwhelmed and couldn't stop my eyes from leaking. Maybe it is just knowing this is it. Maybe it is because I'm proud of myself for doing something so far out of my comfort zone. I don't know but I couldn't, not cry. And now I have new fears for tomorrow....Count down begins

Friday: speech day again.  Only it is my speech day. I think I was more nervous yesterday. Man I don't know what happeened. I had this. I practiced and practiced in a conference room and I was feeling great. I was feeling solid and unemotional. When it came time for the real deal I felt like I gave a decent speech. Sure I barely looked up from my shaking paper, but I felt pretty solid still. Until my last line I couldn't freakin say it. The tears came and I couldn't stop them. I don't have the link to put it up but I will once it is available.

I knew this program would be an experience I couldn't pass up. It was. It was everything I had hoped it would be and more. I feel like it took me 5 weeks to become comfortable here. To let loose and be silly and carefree. Now it's over right? Doesn't seem fair.  I think that Ascend deserves an emotionally charged fairwell. And to be honest I don't know if it is because the speeches were so draining or if I'm in a deep denial, or Britney Spears playing in the Mozilla office, but I don't feel like I can write an appropriate goodbye to Ascend.

Thank you Lukas and Kronda. You have changed all of our lives. Go change some more, the world needs more yous.
