Here we are on the second day of Ascend.  Revisit this space to read my Week 1 blog.

The first day of Ascend was different than I expected.  It was an amazing experience of creating a supportive community.
I learned to embrace my strengths and left feeling energized and drained at the same time.

I had no idea that tech could be THIS supportive!  I mean, I consider myself really lucky to have happened upon Hack the People for my first meet up.  Followed by PyLadies, Women Who Hack and Shawna Scott from Portland Code School. 
I figured that once I was actually working, I would be left out in the frosty, barren world to chuck my own path towards code heaven.

On our first day, Lukas and co had us finding our strengths - using Gallup's Strenth Finder - and owning them.  No.... I mean, really OWNING them.  We talked our newly found strengths, we talked about how we felt about them, we discussed how they related to the program, we chose one to rename and redefine into our own words and then.... we made a promise to the group about how they could count on us to perform to a chosen strength!
