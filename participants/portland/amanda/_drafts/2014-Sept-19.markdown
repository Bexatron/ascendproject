Is it a bug?  Here are some questions to ask yourself:
* Can I reproduce it?
	- every time OR intermittently
		- if intermittently, can you state about how often?
* Open a Clean Profile (if you haven't set up profiles, go here first)  ## put a link in here
* Open a Clean Profile in other versions of Firefox.
	- for example, if you are reproducing this bug in Firefox Nightly, try and see if you find the same bug in a new Firefox Aurora profile.  (This is called "Regression") ##put a link in here
After you have completed these tests, head on over to [Bugzilla@Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).  You'll need to create an account in Bugzilla and later, can sign in using your Persona Account.
