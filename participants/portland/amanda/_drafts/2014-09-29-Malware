## Monday

This happened to me before - on another MacBook.  

Bing * Conduit.com * SearchProtect * CNET supports Malware!? * Perion

So many others seem to have had this issue.  Many of them Windows users, so I had fun trying to a) find information for Mac and Firefox users and b) not download more suggested Malware in the process.

I'll explain b) a little further.  A lot of the solutions included downloading Malware removers that actually install more Spyware, etc on your computer. 

Today, we are researching our bugs and starting the process of creating patches.  Today, I am cleaning Malware off of my MacBook.  fun times.  I found a bug in my default Firefox browser and in following the steps to [reproduce a bug], I found that instead of a bug, I have Malware! 

Two important lessons that I have learned today:  most importantly, pay careful attention to which boxes are checked when you run an installer.  I think I may have taken a quick inhale of surprise when I was too late in noticing said checkbox was already checked by default.

We had been installing many a program and add on that fateful day and I think I let my guard down.  The second thing that I learned today is to carefully document progress.  I have spent over three hours researching different fixes for this "bug."  I found over a dozen procedures to remove this Malware from reputable "helpers" (is StackOverflow, MacForums, etc...).  Not to mention over fifty more sketchy sites offering their Spyware products.  I have started writing this blog because I FINALLY found something that worked for me!  (I seriously cannot believe how many canned answers I found on SUMO and other places online.  Canned responses that did not even come close to finding a fix.  I have to give a shout out to )

The most helpful app that I did end up downloading to help with my eventual fix is [Find Any File](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-any-file/id402569179?mt=12).  You can find it in the App store which is recommended from [Thomas Tempelmann's webpage](http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/).  (I no longer support CNET after finding the Malware included in a few of their installers.)

Chosen Solution

I had the very same issue. Even when I tried deleting it from both my firefox and chrome extensions it still came up when I started either browsers. The only way I've found that this can be fixed is by removing the program using your control panel. Sometimes these crappy mal ware tool bars install actual programs and Search conduit is no different. When you display all your programs (after clicking add or remove programs) you should see a magnifying glass icon next to a program name " search protect". That is the search conduit program and it needs to be deleted. After uninstalling it , restart your browser and everything should be fine.
