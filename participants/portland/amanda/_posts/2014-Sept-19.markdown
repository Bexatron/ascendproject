Week 2:  The pace is perfect for me!  We are working on almost completely different things from what I did at Portland Code School.  Partly, I say this as there is not much to compare between the two programs.  In other words, for those who know that I went through the Fullstack Javascript track, whatever I'm writing about in this blog is NOT a comparison to what I've done before.  Even the GIT flow is slightly different - which is not surprising.

In Ascend, we are working and producing while we are learning.  Learn by doing!  Learn by contributing to open source!

In regards to a blog for this week, I've been working on a Firefox Bug Reporting Tutorial for the very beginner.  It's still in progress and the link can be found below.  

Other fun things we worked on this week:

[Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) * [Moztrap](https://moztrap.mozilla.org/runtests/) * [CrashMe Addon](https://code.google.com/p/crashme/) * [about:about](about:about) * [Persona Account](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/) * [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) * jekyll server *
