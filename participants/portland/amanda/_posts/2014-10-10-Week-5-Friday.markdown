It's Friday afternoon, T-minus 2 minutes until the kiddo arrives.  I'm so excited :)

My pull request was merged this morning....

yay!  bug squashed.  The super great thing about contributing to Mozilla projects is all the support and recognition newbies get:

So, I got to spend most of my day on less concentration intesive things:
 - met with my coach - Larissa is great, bring out the chocolate cake!
 - practiced my talk for next week - need to cut the ramble out just a bit still (we only get 5 minutes!?)
 - Helped fellow ascenders with GitHub issues - fun! 
 - Oh!  I reverted my Wordpress site back to the default theme.  We had a great session with Kronda going through how to customize our site.  I will try again with this new knowledge - just not today.  I think this will require a bit of patience and a big stretch from my end.  Anything related to design for me... hmm.... I love UX, I'm not yet confident in design.  (Hey, any fellow Ascenders want their first WP client?   ...jk....)

 Have a great weekend!
