# First Day Ascending the Spiral Staircase
## September 8, 2014

People have often told me that computers were not for me.  I was not "that kind of person" and programming was "too intense" for me to understand.  Last week, I made a change in my life by believing that I could learn more, do more, be more, and change more.

I joined the Ascend Project.

We are 20 people with various backgrounds and experiences, coming together to learn as much as we can about programming.  Our mission is to contribute to open source web materials in order to improve educational resources and web literacy wherever we can.  As participants in the project and as new Mozillians, we cherish the thoughtful support of each of our teachers, and we are all grateful for the amazing resources Mozilla has offered us.

Thank you, Lukas, Kronda, Dino, Debbie, Katt, Shawna, and each of the Mozillians who have dedicated their time and energy to be part of these moments with us!

During our first day, we shared our expectations, hopes, and goals for what the project would look like.  I was definitely nervous, and expecting a pop quiz in programming language, but I discovered that Day One was the Day of Strength.  We took this day to create a community, empowering each other and providing support whenever needed.

After writing agreements for respecting each other (and ourselves)during the course, we were introduced to the StrengthsFinder assessment, created by the Gallup Strengths Center.  We had 20 seconds to answer each question about our feelings and behaviors.  It's difficult to prioritize things with only 20 seconds!  Each participant received a list of their Top 5 Strengths!

As an exercise in encouragement and empowerment, we discussed our Strengths in small groups, and came together to share what we learned.  I learned a lot about personal strengths by listening to what other people received, and comparing those results to my own.

In the middle of reading my Strengths assessment, I felt like I was reading my own life, described on a piece of paper.  Each one of the categories described my feelings and behaviors so accurately that I felt strongly encouraged to believe in my ability to succeed in Ascend.

My Top 5 Strengths are: Learner, Context, Individualization, Connectedness, and Relator.  Each of these strengths empowers the others, and I love that I've found a way to explain my personality through these strengths.

One of my course goals is to share my Strengths with the combined Strengths of my fellow participants.  We are forming a bond of learning which is changing us all.

Lunch was AWESOME!  There was amazing, excellent, splendid kale salad!  :)

We took a wonderful tour of the Mozilla office, as well (thanks, Katt!) and reflected on our first day together.

At the end of the day, I was somewhat confused, and very tired, but this is an amazing roller coaster ride!
