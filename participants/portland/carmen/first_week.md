The first week of Ascend has been a flood of information, and we're learning as we go, but there's a lot of catching up to do!

We're each creatively multitasking to make contributions while learning different aspects of programming.

So far, I've learned how to use Vim, debugged the Evil Snowperson's photo theft, explored the command line prompts, researched various topics for presentations, solved problems with my classmates, contributed to the Etherpad, identified some bugs, and started designing an HTML page with Webmaker's Thimble!
