Week Two of the Ascend Project has been intense, thrilling, frustrating, and uplifting at times.  I've definitely learned this week that computers will "only do what you tell them to"!  We've learned a lot of new programs and commands for our terminals in such a short time.  The learning process is slow and steady, but we're getting there.

This week, we focused our energies on running tests, checking on bugs, and helping to reproduce bugs found by other contributors.  We had a lot of fun calling each other on our computer screens by using the video call features in Aurora!
