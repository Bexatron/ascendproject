first day at ascend project
===========================

I had a great time meeting all the Portland participants and learning about my 
and their strengths, but not anyone's *technical* strengths. We are all 
welcome here and all have many strengths to offer, whatever our particular 
technical skills. What a wonderful change from those old computer science 
classes!
