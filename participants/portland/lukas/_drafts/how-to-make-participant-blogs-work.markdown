### To make the participant blogs work:

* Create a `_posts` directory in your individual participants directory.
* Create an `index.html` file in your individual participants directory.
* Paste [this code](https://gist.github.com/shawnacscott/87920adff230fa37a61f) in, with your first name as the category in the appropriate places.
* Every time you make a blog post, name it `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.markdown`, and paste this at the top of your file, filling in the appropriate info:

~~~

layout: post
title:  "Title of Your Post"
date:   YEAR-MONTH-DAY
categories: your-participant-name

* If you want to be able to work with drafts and not publish your posts immediately, create a `_drafts` directory in your individual participants directory. When you are ready to publish, move the post to the `_posts` directory.
