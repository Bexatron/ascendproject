##Maker Web Party 

We had a Maker Party today. I used the Popcorn feature to try to edit some video and maybe even make a GIF. It was a little frustrating. I've used video editing software before and I was disappointed that I didn't have more control but here's what I edited from my favorite Russian animated film "The Hedgehog in the Fog." Enjoy. The prompt was "why are you here?"
