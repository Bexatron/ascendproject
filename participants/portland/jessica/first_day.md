#First Day of Ascend Project 

##At Mozilla Headquarters in Portland, Oregon

On the first day of the Ascend Project we were introduced to the Mozilla community through their weekly All-hands Status Meeting. We got to see Mozillans across the world in meeting rooms and from their homes via webcams. It was exciting to hear about all the projects happening at Mozilla. We established agreements to promote a positive learning environment and explored the results of a Strengths test we took and how we can use them for our benefit in the program. It was a promising start.
