##What is Atom?

[**Atom**](https://atom.io) is a Text Editor very similar to Sublime Text but is open source, so its 100% free and mod-able.
Atom has [Themes](https://atom.io/themes) and [Packages](https://atom.io/packages) that can be downloaded and installed to allow you customize
your user experience.

[Color Pickers](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) for CSS work and much more.
