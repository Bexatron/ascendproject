## And we're off!

Today the first inquiry from the site came in.  Things are getting **very** real now. The application form is up on the site, and we'll start putting out press releases, social media pushes, and getting flyers & posters distributed in Portland next week.

Here's what I've learned so far in getting to this point:

* Everything took longer than I'd estimated
* It never occurred to me until giving a presentation to Mozilla Foundation folks that I had zero plan for a press strategy
* People asked great questions at that informal chat including: Would we have a bug tracker? (Yes, we do now on GitHub) What happens *after* this? (Working on pulling in more opportunities for grads including OPW and hopefully internships with other projects) What's the four year goal? (I'm working on this one - having more of these programs in more places seems like the obvious answer for now)
* I am trying to get better at asking for help and it's paying off (Thank you [Madhava](http://www.madhava.com/egotism/) for the [poster](/resources/poster.pdf)!)
* Definitely getting more familiar with Jekyll and markdown which is great because it allows every aspect of this project & website can be open 

Now that the applications are kicked off, here's what's next:

* Looking for volunteers to spread the word on the ground in Portland (see [volunteers](/volunteers/))
* Getting posters & flyers printed and distributed
* Launching some press materials and looking for opportunities to talk up the project
* Keynoting at Open Source Bridge about the project and looking for contributors & mentors at the conference
* Processing applications and making sure people get office hours if they need them
* Setting up office hours with the Portland Space
* Doing the Training-Up program with Greg Wilson as I start iterating on the curriculum

Update on deadlines coming up:

* June 30th - Applications close
* July 15th - Start interviewing applicants who have completed Round 2 (Codeacademy's [JavaScript module](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript))
* July 30th - 20 Participants selected and notified for the Portland group
