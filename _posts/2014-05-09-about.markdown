The Ascend Project is a 6 week, full time course that removes many barriers and allows participants time and support as they focus on learning typical open source practices: IRC, bug trackers, code review, committing patches, and the larger opportunities available to users & developers of the open web. The curriculum will focus on setting people up to succeed, getting hooked on solving problems with code, and being a part of a bigger community with a mission for global good. The intention is to provide a counter the manner in which many populations are either completely ignored, or sometimes pushed away from participation in computer science and open source contributions when it costs too much to join in.

This site is served and hosted on GitHub so that all the materials, as they are being developed, can be available for viewing/inpuut/contribution.  Please get in touch if you'd like to know more.
