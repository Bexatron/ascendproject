#Monday
Everyone showed up!  We started strong on Monday morning with all 20
of the participants, Kronda, myself, Debbie, and Dino and we got to work first
by drafting a final version of the attendance expectations that everyone 
would feel comfortable signing.

We then did a designed alliance - which means everyone gets to speak out
about what they needed from our shared space to be able to learn and feel
safe being here.  We have those [agreements][agreements] digitized now and they are located
in the repo.

Debbie was here in Portland for the first day and a half and she helped run
the Strengths Finder portion.  This involved having the cohort do an online
quiz at the [Gallup Strength Finder][strength_finder] site and then
each person gets a custom list of their top 5 strengths.  These were the starting
point for our getting to know each other, as our strengths and what they mean to us.

Something I learned was that instead of just telling people why I chose to start
us off with this particular exercise, instead I asked the room "Why do you think 
we started with this?" and amazingly, everything I would have told them came
out from them.

At the end of the first day, many expressed their appreciation for the work 
on strengths and yet several seemed nervous that we hadn't just dived right in
to high level coding.  I try to assure them it will happen, we're not going to
rush things. There's a lot more to this course in terms of preparation and
community building with each other that will be needed to make us strong going
forward.

Badges!  One of the best moments on this day was having each participant create
a badge to give all the others - celebrating their successes so far. You can see those
at [https://badges.mozilla.org/en-US/badges/?q=ascend][badges.mozilla.org] where they
have (mostly) been tagged with 'ascend' to help people find them.
