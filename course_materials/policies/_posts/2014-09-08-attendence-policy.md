Excellent attendance is an expectation of all Ascend Project participants
and is required in order to be gifted the laptop that participants use
during the the program at it's completion.

Daily attendance over the 6 weeks of the program is the key to building
a community presence and connecting with mentors in order to complete
technical contributions that build participants' portfolios, providing them
with tangible outcomes that can assist in creating future opportunities.

There is an honorarium for each full day of attendance, which is defined as:

	A full day of attendance requires being at the Mozilla Portland office
	9am - 5pm each day, to be in the classroom area, and to participate
	fully in the daily material as well as being a respectful and supportive
	member in your cohort in order to build a solid team.

Attendance will be recorded between 9am-9:30am every morning as computers
are signed out to each person for the day and then again at 5pm when the
computers are returned. If someone is absent, misses sign in/out, is
disruptive in class to the point of being asked to leave, or doesn't
participate in the day's work there will be no honorarium paid for that day.

To complete the course with full participation, resulting in the laptop being
given to the participant, there must be no unscheduled absences, no more than 10
days of absence overall, and any emergency absences/lateness must follow
the established process.

A scheduled absence must:

* be pre-arranged with the course leader
* before 5pm end of class the day before the absence occurs
* have confirmation from course leader in email to the participant with the
adjustment to the honorarium based on the following:
** no penalty for 1/4 day or less absence when needed for appointments with care
providers or other wellness needs (includes commute time)
** 1/2 day absence = 1/2 daily honorarium
** more than 1/2 day absence = no honorarium

In case of emergency or 'out of your control' absence/lateness:
* Call/text the course leader to let them know the situation and whether to expect you that day

PHONE NUMBER #1 ____________________________


PHONE NUMBER #2 ____________________________

* The honorarium will be adjusted according to the above schedule
* Emergency/unexpected absence for more than 1/2 the day will result in no honorarium that day

As much as possible, these should be minimal and pre-arranged
before the course begins.  Any absences during the course that are unscheduled
and/or result in missing class time will result in no honorarium for that day.

Any extra-curricular activities that take place outside of the 9am-5pm window
are not part of this attendance policy, they are optional, and do not
impact participant honorariums.
