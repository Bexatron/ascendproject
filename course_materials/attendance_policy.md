Attendance Policy
=================


As there is an honorarium for each full day of attendance, we should outline what that means.

A full day of attendance means being at the office from 9am - 5pm each day in order to participate fully in the course material and support your fellow students in building up the team.

Any full day absence will result in no honorarium for that day. 


Partial absences can be considered for pre-arranged situations at the discretion of the course leads and the participant based on an understanding of the individual's needs.  These must be pre-arranged before the course begins.  Any absences during the course that are unplanned and result in missing partial hours will result in a half honorarium for that day.
