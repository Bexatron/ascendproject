Attendance Policy
=================


Excellent attendance is an expectation of all Ascend Project participants. 

Daily attendance over the 6 weeks of the program is the key to building 
a community presence and connecting with mentors in order to complete 
technical contributions that build participants' portfolios, providing them
with tangible outcomes that can assist in creating future opportunities.

There is an honorarium for each full day of attendance, which is defined as:

	A full day of attendance requires being at the Mozilla Portland office
	9am - 5pm each day, to be in the classroom area, and to participate 
	fully in the daily material as well as being a respectful and supportive
	member in your cohort in order to build a solid team.

Attendance will be recorded at 9am every day and if absent, there will 
be no honorarium paid for that day. 

Scheduled absences can be arranged for personal reasons at the 
discretion of the course leader-mentors, with proper communication from
the participant, depending on circumstances.  These should be pre-arranged 
before the course begins.  Any absences during the course that are unplanned 
and result in missing class time will result in no honorarium for that day.

Any extra-curricular activities that take place outside of the 9am-5pm window
are not part of this attendance policy, they are optional, and do not 
impact the participant's honorariums.
